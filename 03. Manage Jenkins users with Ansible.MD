Below is a **step-by-step guide** on how to **execute the Ansible playbook** to manage Jenkins users and roles in **real-time**. This guide assumes you already have Ansible installed and a Jenkins server that is accessible for configuration.

### Prerequisites

- **Jenkins** is installed and running with the **Role Strategy Plugin** or **Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin** for managing roles and permissions.
- **Ansible** is installed on your local machine or control node.
- You have SSH access to the Jenkins server (or API access if using token-based authentication).
- You have **admin access** to Jenkins for managing users and roles.

---

### Step 1: Install Required Ansible Modules

Before you start, ensure that the required Ansible modules are available.

#### Install Ansible Collections for Jenkins
You’ll need the `community.general` collection, which includes the `jenkins_user`, `jenkins_role`, and `jenkins_plugin` modules.

Run the following command to install it:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

---

### Step 2: Set Up Ansible Inventory

Define your Jenkins server in the **Ansible inventory** so Ansible knows where to connect. You can do this by creating an **inventory file** (e.g., `inventory.ini`).

#### Example of an inventory file (`inventory.ini`):

```ini
[jenkins]
jenkins_server ansible_host=your.jenkins.server.url ansible_user=your_username ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/ssh/key

# Alternatively, if using an API token, use:
# jenkins_server ansible_host=your.jenkins.server.url ansible_user=your_username jenkins_api_token=your_api_token
```

- **`your.jenkins.server.url`**: Replace with your actual Jenkins server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
- **`your_username`**: Replace with your Jenkins admin username.
- **`/path/to/ssh/key`**: The SSH private key if you're using SSH access to the Jenkins server.
- Alternatively, if you're using **API token** for authentication, add `jenkins_api_token`.

### Step 3: Create the Ansible Playbook

Now, create the Ansible playbook file that will handle user and role management. Save it as `manage_jenkins_users.yml`.

#### Example Playbook (`manage_jenkins_users.yml`):

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Jenkins Users and Roles for Dev, QA, and Prod
  hosts: jenkins
  vars:
    # Define Users with their roles
    jenkins_users:
      - { name: "dev_user1", password: "dev_pass1", api_token: "api_token_dev1", role: "developer" }
      - { name: "dev_user2", password: "dev_pass2", api_token: "api_token_dev2", role: "developer" }
      - { name: "dev_user3", password: "dev_pass3", api_token: "api_token_dev3", role: "developer" }

      - { name: "qa_user1", password: "qa_pass1", api_token: "api_token_qa1", role: "qa" }
      - { name: "qa_user2", password: "qa_pass2", api_token: "api_token_qa2", role: "qa" }
      - { name: "qa_user3", password: "qa_pass3", api_token: "api_token_qa3", role: "qa" }

      - { name: "prod_user1", password: "prod_pass1", api_token: "api_token_prod1", role: "prod" }
      - { name: "prod_user2", password: "prod_pass2", api_token: "api_token_prod2", role: "prod" }
      - { name: "prod_user3", password: "prod_pass3", api_token: "api_token_prod3", role: "prod" }
      - { name: "prod_user4", password: "prod_pass4", api_token: "api_token_prod4", role: "prod" }

    # Define Roles and Permissions
    jenkins_roles:
      - { name: "developer", permissions: ["Job/Build", "Job/Read", "Job/Configure", "Job/Create"] }
      - { name: "qa", permissions: ["Job/Build", "Job/Read", "Job/Configure"] }
      - { name: "prod", permissions: ["Job/Read", "Job/Workspace"] }

  tasks:
    - name: Create Jenkins users
      jenkins_user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        password: "{{ item.password }}"
        api_token: "{{ item.api_token }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ jenkins_users }}"

    - name: Create Jenkins roles with permissions
      jenkins_role:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        permissions: "{{ item.permissions }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ jenkins_roles }}"

    - name: Assign roles to users
      jenkins_role:
        name: "{{ item.role }}"
        users:
          - "{{ item.name }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ jenkins_users }}"
```

### Explanation of the Playbook:

1. **Variables**:
   - **`jenkins_users`**: A list of users, their passwords, API tokens, and assigned roles.
   - **`jenkins_roles`**: A list of roles with associated permissions (e.g., `developer`, `qa`, `prod`).
   
2. **Tasks**:
   - **Create Jenkins users**: Uses the `jenkins_user` module to create users.
   - **Create roles**: Uses the `jenkins_role` module to create roles and assign permissions.
   - **Assign roles to users**: Uses the `jenkins_role` module to assign the appropriate role to each user.

### Step 4: Run the Playbook

After setting up the inventory and playbook, execute the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini manage_jenkins_users.yml
```

- **`-i inventory.ini`**: Specifies your Ansible inventory file.
- **`manage_jenkins_users.yml`**: Specifies the playbook you want to run.

This command will:
1. Connect to your Jenkins server.
2. Create 10 users in Jenkins.
3. Create the roles `developer`, `qa`, and `prod`.
4. Assign the appropriate roles to each user.
5. Assign permissions for each role.

### Step 5: Verify the Changes

1. **Log into Jenkins**: After running the playbook, log into Jenkins as an admin.
2. **Check Users**: Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Users** to verify that the users were created successfully.
3. **Check Roles and Permissions**: Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Configure Global Security** → **Role-Based Authorization Strategy** to verify that the roles were created and assigned correctly.

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors, check the Ansible output for any issues related to user creation or permission assignments.
- Ensure that Jenkins is accessible and that your API token or SSH key is correctly configured in the Ansible inventory.
- If Jenkins is behind a proxy, you may need to adjust Ansible's connection settings for network access.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have automated the process of creating Jenkins users, assigning them roles, and setting up permissions using **Ansible**. This method can scale well as you add more users or adjust roles in the future. You can also modify the playbook to accommodate changes in your Jenkins configuration or permissions model.
